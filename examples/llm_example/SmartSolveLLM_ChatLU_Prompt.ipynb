        "        ```julia\n",
        "    $feature_gets\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "    - Do **not** use named parameters in the function signature (e.g., `; sparsity=...` is not allowed).\n",
        "    - Use `if/elseif/else` logic to express the heuristic clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - You must return **only one** of the following algorithms, as a string literal: $algorithms\n",
        "    - Do **not** modify or extend algorithm names (e.g., avoid returning `\"umfpack_triangular\"` instead of `\"umfpack\"`).\n",
        "    - Each `return` statement must use **only one** of the allowed strings exactly as written above.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Note: Some feature names may suggest Boolean values (e.g., `issymmetric`, `ishermitian`, `isreal`), but in the dataset, they are represented as numeric indicators (e.g., 0 or 1). Do **not** treat them as Booleans — instead, compare them numerically using expressions like `issymmetric == 1`.\n",
