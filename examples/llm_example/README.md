# ChatLU LLM Notebook

This notebook will demonstrate a method to prompt an LLM using Ollama with a SmartSolve algorithmic database and receive both a heuristic and LLM reasoning. We will also benchmark the heuristic results to see if it is a viable alternative to the current decision tree generated by the SmartSolve function.

Simply run the code in the cells which have instructions and comments denoting their purpose.
